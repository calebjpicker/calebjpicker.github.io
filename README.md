Welcome!

My name is Caleb J. Picker, and I am an aspiring data scientist.  Here, you will find my projects aimed to develop my experience and expertise in data science.

I've taken Coursera courses in Machine Learning (Andrew Ng) and Mathematics of Machine Learning Specialization. 

My first project is an automated stock trading program. I am following Dr. Xu's "Practice Quantitative Finance Using R":
