# Portfolio
Welcome!

My name is Caleb J. Picker.  I aim to develop my experience and expertise in data science.  

[Please go to my website to find my projects](https://calebjpicker.github.io/portfolio/).  


**Projects**

My first project is an [automated stock trading program]("./stock/Automated Stock Trading.html"). I am following Dr. Xu's ["Practical Quantitative Finance Using R"](https://www.drxudotnet.com/rquant.php).

Check back here to view my progress.  I will post projects as I work on them.

**Certificates**

I've taken Coursera courses in [Machine Learning (Andrew Ng)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/8KN2KE87YY9Z) and [Mathematics of Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/QCXQMYWVYYCU).
